this project is bootstraped with create-react-app.

next step is to subscribe to a data-source which should be a HOC.

I don't think It's a good practice for HOC...

Main data-flow completed, you can download,install dependency.
Then run `npm start` on your terminal, `console` shows every action and state.

I'm starting another Demo which simulates the process of creating/edit deposite plan in this folder...and It went well so far.
Dont have deadline So no pressure.

update TransIn Demo with selected List as Child Component,reserving all state in Store,so No trouble in persisting UserInput-State.If you wanna try it out ,start demo and click everything...

`<select>` doesnt own `onSelect` event but onChange.And the defaultValue that comes with React doesnt seem to be working ... dont know why, I'll figure oue later. *Bath Time.*

Oh there is one more thing ,i forgot adding `react-redux` dependency,already Updated.
